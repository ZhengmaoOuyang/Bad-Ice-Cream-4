# Bad Ice Cream 4 (Dec 2018 - Jan 2019)
My final project for ICS4U (Grade 12 Computer Science). Bad Ice Cream 4 is my take on the popular Bad Ice Cream online video game series, where players in the form of ice creams must complete levels by collecting fruits, manipulating ice blocks, and avoiding enemies. 

### Demo Instructions
Simply download and run the BIC4Final.jar file! The password to get into the game is: 100%.

#### Useful Links
Pages accessed for the project are included in a bibliography at the end of the User Manual in the Documentation folder.

#### Assets
All game object artwork comes directly from the original Bad Ice Cream series, and belongs to the creators of the game. Buttons, titles, and labels are my own.

Background artwork was sourced from Google Images. The specific sources are still being compiled. 

Background music and SFX were sourced from Youtube. The specific sources are still being compiled.
